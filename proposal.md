# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Cryptocurrency Predictor 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that lets you pick a cryptocurrency and view its predicted price within a specified amount of days.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Initially, the software will ask you which cryptocurrency you would like to predict the price of. Then, it will ask you how many days forward you would like to see the price of. If you do not know which currency
you would like to choose then you can pick a randomized cryptocurrency. It will then ask you how many days forward you would like to see the price of. Furthermore, you will see line graph displaying the name of 
the cryptocurrency, dates, and prices for those dates. This will executed through entering it into the program or through a discord command (this has yet to be determined).

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Ian Thorpe, tup56195@temple.edu, Zhengkang Fan. 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what we will have a way to choose a cryptocurrency, the days predicted, disply a graph, and have a randomizer. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be to have all these features as a discord bot or have some sort of animation with it. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is having all those features both as a discord bot and an animation. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to work with some API packages that I have not worked with in the past. For example, I'm going have to understand how to create graphs and animations. I will have to research the best APIs
and discord bot commands. Ian will work on the animation and randomization part of the project. I will do the graph and the discord bot part of it. We will split the data prediction part of it.
