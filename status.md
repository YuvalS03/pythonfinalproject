Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We have created a discord bot called the Crypto Crab. 
It currently has a couple test commands to make sure it works and runs.
There is an event that edits itself to look like a wheel spinning.
There is also another file that can make a graph with current cryptocurrency
prices. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We have not done the predicting price part of the project.
We have also not figured out how to display the graph on discord.
We need to create the option to choose from at least two cryptocurrencies.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

When we tried to run the code to predict the price it endlessly
printed irrelevant data. Also, we need to figure out how to make the bot
edit messages faster and make it send the graph.
